## [Use Case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9iMniDn_P9BYeRMWgg-3JFajvIzjrDRyh-nXqjIYyw/edit)

## UI analysis

### Open the rules

**1** click from main menu and game activities

### Start a new single player game

**2** clicks and **1** swipe from the main menu activity = **3** actions in total

### Join a multiplayer game

**1-2** clicks to open the list of games (1 for WIFI p2p and 2 for internet) + **2** clicks to join + **0-1** input fields to enter (depends on whever this game is locked or not) = **3-5** actions in total

### Start a new multiplayer game

**2-3** clicks to open dialogue (2 for WIFI p2p and 3 for internet) + **1** swipe to specify the max number of players + **0-1** text input feilds to feel (depends on whever one wants the game to be locked) + **1** click to create game = **4-6** actions in total

### What can be improved

Firstly, settings and rules activities should be accessible from game room (where players wait for room to be full to start the game), not just from main menu and game activities.

Secondly, the game screen looks terrible. We should use some graphical libraries (like LibGDX) which allow to easily make beutiful animations.

Thirdly, we should add an ability to see what the other people know about their hands. We also should add a game events log.

Fourthly, PDF for rules is bad, we should make it as a text with pictures.
